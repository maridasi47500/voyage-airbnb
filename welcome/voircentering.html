Identify your key muscles
These are the muscles that are most critical for you to have control
over, but are also the muscles most likely to tighten up under pressure.

<p><b>
What is your intention for the phrase you are about to play? In other
words, what is the mood or character? How do the dynamics,
articulation, tone, phrasing, tempo, etc. contribute to this? Write down
your ideas, hear it in your head exactly like you'd like it to sound, then
give it a shot.  (Don Juan) Energetic, but light - like it’s the easiest thing in the world

this time? What will you try to do exactly the same?

Close your eyes and think back to your top 2 or 3 performances ever.
See if you can recall how you sounded, and particularly how you felt
(kinesthetically, not emotionally per se) when performing in that
incredible state of “flow” where everything just clicks.
Write down some of the important details of what you recall.
If this is difficult, think about lessons, rehearsals, or even in practice
room settings, how do your key muscles and body feel when you are
playing exactly as you wish?
Rehearse this feeling inside your mind/body without actually making
these motions on your instrument. How does it feel? Can you picture it
and feel it clearly? Does it feel real?

Cue words
This step is optional. Some prefer to avoid using words in this process
as they find that it triggers left-brain analysis and thoughts of
technique, but others find a cue word helpful as a reminder or
“anchor” to facilitate recall of these kinesthetic and auditory elements.
Words such as balance, heavy arm, light touch, feathery, oily, flowing
air, etc.
Experiment with a few until you identify some words or short phrases
that “trigger” that very vivid recollection of what it feels like to
generate the sounds that you hear in your mind. Write them down
here so you don't forget.
